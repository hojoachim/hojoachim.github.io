                            data-body="Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that exhibit self-similarity across different scales. They are formed by repeating a simple process in a continuous feedback loop. For example, the recursive formula Z_n+1 = (Z_n)^2 + C generates the famous Mandelbrot set (upper left picture). Because they are driven by recursion, fractals visually represent dynamic systems—often described as pictures of chaos. Geometrically, they exist between our familiar dimensions. Fractals also appear in nature, such as in snowflakes, mountain ranges, lightning bolts, coastlines, and plants (lower right picture). I came across the world of fractals as a student in the 1980s, and I remain fascinated by their intricate beauty and the mathematical principles behind them."

I also love the beautiful vocal harmonies of groups like Boyz II Men or Pentatonix, and I am a fan of the classical/pop crossover cellist Hauser. As a student and member of the Leipzig University Choir, I first came into close contact with classical music. We would perform works such as Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas Oratorio, the St. Matthew and St. John Passions, cantatas, and other Baroque music. Since that time, I’ve been exploring more classical composers, such as Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Mahler. Recently, I have been captivated by the works of Richard Wagner and his addictive musical dramas. Nothing beats Wotan’s Love motif in The Valkyrie, pure goosebumps..."

Working for a Japanese company at the time, I learned a great deal about the culture, language, and people of Japan. Over the years, I came to appreciate the way of life here, the blend of tradition and modernity, the respect for nature, the politeness and hospitality of the people, and, of course, the amazing food. So I decided to move to Japan for good. I live and work in the vibrant city of Tokyo, but I love exploring the many beautiful places in this country, especially the hot springs. Fun fact: Did you know that the Japanese writing system uses two syllable alphabets with 46 characters each, plus about 2000 kanji characters borrowed from Chinese? Speaking of challenges..."

While this would also constitute the basis for my professional career in semiconductor research and development, I've always been intrigued by the fundamental principles that govern the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. I enjoy delving into topics such as quantum mechanics with its mysterious and hard-to-grasp concepts, versus Einstein's genius theory of relativity, and cosmology as a whole. I wonder if mankind will ever find the world formula, a theory of everything that combines all fundamental forces of nature, uniting quantum mechanics with general relativity. By the way, do you know Newton's bucket? It's a thought experiment that has implications for our understanding of space and motion. How do you think water in a spinning bucket would behave in an otherwise empty universe?"

I've been taking this course to deepen my understanding of coding and computer science principles. The course covers a wide range of topics, starting with the traditional but omnipresent language called C, then transitioning to the higher-level language Python (on which I actually completed the separate CS50 Python course in parallel), and introducing SQL for databases, as well as web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In fact, this very webpage is part of my CS50 journey! CS50 teaches computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. I’m excited to complete the remaining lectures by Prof. Malan and then work on the final project (with helpful support from the cute CS50 duck debugger) to finish the course."

Living in a Far East island nation like Japan naturally involves quite a bit of traveling when visiting family and friends back in Europe or in other parts of the world. But I enjoy traveling and discovering new places, cuisines, and landscapes. My favorite is being somewhere with a beach and a nice ocean view. I also like languages. Going to school in East Germany, I had to learn Russian as my first foreign language, followed by English. Later in Japan, I studied Japanese, which is still a work in progress, especially when it comes to reading and writing. Recently, I started learning Spanish, and I want to refresh my Russian. Someday, I’d love to watch Tchaikovsky’s masterpiece ballet Swan Lake at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, and be able to ask my way around in Russian."
